<p><strong><div>Synopsis: (via Wiki)</div></strong></p>
<h4>
<p>Peter Benjamin Parker is a high school student who gained spider-like abilities, fighting crime across New York City as the alter ego Spider-Man, hoping someday, he will live up to his heroes in the Avengers.  While Parker juggled all his continued superhero duties with the demands of his high-school life, he was approached by Tony Stark who recruited Spider-Man to join the Avengers Civil War, putting Spider-Man into the brief conflict with his personal hero, Captain America. Parker then agreed and was given his new suit as well as brand new Stark technology in exchange for all his help, although Stark still did not make him an official member of the Avengers and instead returned Parker back home to continue his own hero work.

One afternoon in 2016, Parker returned home from school, greeting May and mentioning a 'crazy car' parked outside the apartment building before being left speechless at Stark, who was by this point his idol and was sitting with May in the living room couch. Parker became confused when Stark told his aunt that Stark Industries planned to give him a sizable grant, claiming that Parker had signed up for it in the past, but in fact, Parker did not know about the grant, let alone sign up for it.

In a private conversation,  Stark discovered the makeshift outfit that Parker used as his costume and blew his cover. Parker then confessed that he had been Spider-Man for six months. Stark ridiculed Parker for his cheap costume, but found the tensile strength of his web fluid the most impressive aspect of his getup and learned that Parker himself designed it.</p>

<h4>
<p>Parker became defensive when Stark mocked the design of Parker's goggles from his costume, explaining that the goggles helped him focus his senses. When Stark asked why he became Spider-Man, Parker, without going into detail, explained that he understood that he needed to stop bad things from happening. Stark invited him to come to Germany to confront Captain America, but Parker claimed he had too much homework to join the mission.
Stark said that the mission could be dangerous and decided to tell May that he was taking Parker out on a field trip. As Stark walked toward the door, Parker overreacted and used his web-Shooters to bind Stark's hand to the doorknob, pleading with him to keep the truth from May. Stark relented but asked to be freed from the webbing, and an embarrassed Parker freed his hand from the door before the pair left for Germany.</p>

Peter Parker is also full of pop culture references!!
<em>Hey, guys, you ever see that really old movie, Empire Strikes Back? You know that part? Where they're on the snow planet, with the walking thingies?"</em>
―Spider-Man to War Machine and Iron Man
Two months after the Avengers Civil War, Parker continued his daily life as a high school student at the Midtown School of Science and Technology, where he continued to try to get back into contact with Happy Hogan in order to arrange another mission with the Avengers to prove his worth, only to find Hogan would not reply to his messages.Going into the class, Parker watched clips of himself as the Spider-Man saving people's lives to try and get a sense of the public's perception of him. However, Monica Warren noticed he was not paying attention and, once Thompson had just failed to answer her question correctly, invited Parker to figure out the new science question. Parker, however, took one look at the board and correctly solved the problem, much to Thompson's annoyance as Warren then complimented Parker.As his search for people to aid with his super-powers proved more challenging than he expected as he struggled to find some legitimate crimes going on which he could stop, Spider-Man ended up using his time on the streets to perform minor acts of kindness, including helping to guide an old woman through New York City when she had gotten lost, being rewarded with a churro for his efforts in helping her, which Spider-Man gratefully took and later ate and enjoyed.

<p><strong>Bank Robbery:</strong></p>
<p><em>"What's up, guys? Forgot your PIN number? Whoa! You're the Avengers! What are you guys doing here? Thor, Hulk – nice to finally meet you guys. Thought you'd be more handsome in person. Iron Man! What are you doing robbing a bank? You're a billionaire."</em>
―Spider-Man to Criminal Avengers</p>

Spider-Man then fought them all off effortless, continuing to mock them all for their attempted robbery and for their cheap masks. During the fight, Spider-Man took the robber dressed as Thor and threw him into the robber dressed as Hulk. Using his enhanced abilities as well as his own Web-Shooters, Spider-Man soon subdued almost all of the robbers, becoming more confident as the fight went on with Spider-Man easily dominating the entire skirmish.

However, one of the thugs used a highly advanced Anti-Gravity Gun made from Chitauri technology to even the odds, knocking back Spider-Man. The fight resulted in one of the weapons accidentally destroying one of the nearby shops where Delmar was working. Spider-Man managed to capture the thieves and rescue Delmar and his cat before allowing the New York City Police Department and Damage Control to come in and deal with the robbers.

<p><h2>Party Invitation</h2></p>
"What are you doing?"
"Helping you out, did you not hear her? Liz has a crush on you."
―Peter Parker and Ned Leeds
Parker tried to resume his daily life with his friend aware of his heroic activities. On the way to School, Parker explained to Ned Leeds how he gained his powers from being bitten by the spider, noting that the spider was now dead. On route, they came across the aftermath of the Robbery at Queens Community Bank, as Parker noted the arrival of Damage Control and Anne Marie Hoag before they continued towards school.
